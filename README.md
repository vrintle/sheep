Useful tricks to remember while solving problems:

- In $\text{avg} = x$ problems on array $a$, you can do $a[i] = a[i] - x$ for all $i$, so that size of subarr/subseq becomes irrelevant. [https://codeforces.com/gym/104471/problem/C]
- For median problems, you can use "replace by $-1,$ $+1$" trick to estimate the median. [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1486/D]
- To factorize large numbers upto $10^{18}$, we must use Pollard Rho's algorithm, which works in $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/4})$.
- Never compare floats/doubles with 128-bit integers in C++ (__int128). [https://codeforces.com/gym/101485/problem/K]
