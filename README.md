Useful tricks to remember while solving problems:

- In average = x problems on array A, you can do A[i] -= x for all i, so that size of subarr/subseq becomes irrelevant. [https://codeforces.com/gym/104471/problem/C]
- For median problems, you can use "replace by -1, +1" trick to estimate the median. [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1486/D]
